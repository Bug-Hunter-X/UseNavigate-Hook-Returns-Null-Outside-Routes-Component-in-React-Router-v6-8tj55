In React Router Dom v6, using the `useNavigate` hook inside a component that's not directly a child of a `Routes` component can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `useNavigate` hook relies on the router context, which might not be available in components deeply nested or rendered outside the standard routing hierarchy. This results in `useNavigate` returning null, causing errors when attempting to navigate.
