The solution involves ensuring that `useNavigate` is called within a component that is a direct child of or has access to the router context via a provider such as `BrowserRouter` or `MemoryRouter`. This often requires restructuring the component tree to place the navigation logic within the appropriate routing context.

```jsx
// FixedNavigation.jsx
import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/new-route');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Navigate</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

```

By keeping `MyComponent` nested within the `<Routes>` element, you ensure the `useNavigate` hook will always function correctly.
